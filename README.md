# restbucks
Java implementation of the Restbucks application based on REST in Practice — exploring RESTful service design and hypermedia.

# Restbucks

This is a Java-based implementation of the **Restbucks** application, inspired by the book _REST in Practice: Hypermedia and Systems Architecture_ by Jim Webber, Savas Parastatidis, and Ian Robinson.

The goal of this project is to explore and implement the concepts, patterns, and RESTful architecture styles presented in the book, using **Java**, **Maven**, and **IntelliJ IDEA**.

## 📖 Inspiration

This project is **based on the book**:

> **REST in Practice: Hypermedia and Systems Architecture**  
> by *Jim Webber*, *Savas Parastatidis*, and *Ian Robinson*  
> [O'Reilly Media, 2010]

I highly recommend the book for anyone interested in real-world RESTful service design and hypermedia-driven systems.  
Huge thanks to the authors for creating such a practical and insightful resource.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Java
- Maven
- IntelliJ IDEA
- HTTP/REST (JAX-RS or Spring to be added later)

## 🚧 Status

This project is a work in progress as I follow the examples and design principles from the book, adapting them into working Java code.
